- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m David Flores who goes by the pseudonym of @SlimRunner online.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in math, music, videogames, and programming. I'm always looking for ways in which I can integrate programming to make any of my interests easier or even more interesting.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning dynamic programming because I know it will help strenghten my problem solving skills, and also because there's just something magical about seeing the solution to a problem that done badly could take millions of years.
